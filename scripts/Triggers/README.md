### Works Best on 1H timeframe, But I'm working on getting it to work on 15m as well. 

#### how to use:

(long)
 -  buy signal: on green tick tick
 -  sell /short signal: on red tick
  
(short)
-  short on red tick
-  warning to go long on green.
-  final warning to stop short on orange 'stop short'

### Combination of: 

* Uses: Trend, Price, Momentum. 

* MACD
* RSI
* previous and current HIGHS and LOWS
* and various Simple Moving Average and Exponential Moving Average


## TODO:

* Fix bug where multiple stop shorts and "sell" signals happen in a row for no reason..
* I would like to add some volume metric like an average PVT over a period or something.
